# TicTacToe in very few lines

Tic Tac Toe in 1 line of python code. To run/execute this code for yourself simply clone the repo the single line and run it with a python 3.x.x interpreter. This code was written by hand without the use of minifiers or other code generating tool as a coding challenge for myself.

NOTE: This code uses the print() and input() so please check that your IO works
